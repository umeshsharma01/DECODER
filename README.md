# DECODER
A Decoder is a combinational digital circuit that converts binary input data into a unique active output line.
It takes an n-bit binary input and activates only one of the 2ⁿ output lines, while all other outputs remain inactive.
Decoders are widely used in memory addressing, instruction decoding, data routing, and display systems. 
Decoders are essential in digital systems because they simplify the process of selecting specific devices or operations from multiple possibilities.
By using logic gates, a decoder ensures accurate and efficient signal selection in processors, microcontrollers, and communication systems.
